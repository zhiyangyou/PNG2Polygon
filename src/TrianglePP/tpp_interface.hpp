    @brief Declaration of the main Delaunay class and Iterators of the Triangle++ wrapper

      This is a wrapper for the original Triangle (aka TriLib) code by J.R. Shewchuk. It can create 
      standard Delaunay triangulations, quality Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay 
      triangulations and, last but not least, also Voronoi diagrams.

      Original Triangle/TriLib code: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

    @changes
       11/03/06: piyush - Fixed the compilation system.
       10/25/06: piyush - Wrapped in tpp namespace for usage with other libraries with similar names.
                          Added some more documentation/small changes. Used doxygen 1.5.0 and dot. Tested 
                          compilation with icc 9.0/9.1, gcc-4.1/3.4.6. 
       10/21/06: piyush - Replaced vertexsort with C++ sort.
       08/24/11: mrkkrj - Ported to Visual Studio, added comp. operators, reformatted and added some comments 
       10/15/11: mrkkrj - added support for the "quality triangulation" option, added some debug support
       11/07/11: mrkkrj - bugfix in Triangle's divandconqdelauney() 
       17/09/18: mrkkrj – ported to 64-bit (preliminary, not thorougly tested!) 
       22/01/20: mrkkrj – added support for custom constraints (angle and area) 
       17/04/20: mrkkrj – added support for Voronoi tesselation 
       05/08/22: mrkkrj – added more tests for constrained PSLG triangulations, included (reworked) Yejneshwar's 
                          fix for removal of concavities 
       17/12/22: mrkkrj – Ported to Linux, reworked Yejneshwar's fix again 
       30/12/22: mrkkrj – added first file read-write support 
       03/02/23: mrkkrj – added first support for input sanitization 
       15/03/23: mrkkrj – added support for iteration over the resulting mesh, some refactorings 
       27/03/23: mrkkrj – API break, removed old (i.e. deprecated) names, changed comment formatting
       05/07/23: mrkkrj – set TriLib's SELF_CHECK option as default, make it overridable with TRIANGLE_NO_TRILIB_SELFCHECK,
                          bugfix TriLib internal error in deletevertex()
       29/09/23: mrkkrj – first support for regions and regional constraints
       24/10/23: mrkkrj – support for DLL builds
